    Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun

    He took his vorpal sword in hand:
      Long time the manxome foe he sought --
    So rested he by the Tumtum tree,
      And stood awhile in thought.
    And, as in uffish thought he stood,
      The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,
    Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,
      And burbled as it came!
    One, two! One, two! And through and through
      The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!
    He left it dead, and with its head
      He went galumphing back.
    "And, has thou slain the Jabberwock?
      Come to my arms, my beamish boy!
    O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!'
      He chortled in his joy.
